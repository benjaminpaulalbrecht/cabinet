A library of snippets and code tangles. Branches represent the various IDEs and text editors I use every day. master branch just clones the readme.md

Naming Specification: 
xePy 
Where: 
  x := snippet / tangle / macro generator 
  e := engine where the snippet / tangle / macro is operating on 
  y := type: 
    := s (snippet) 
    := t (tangle) 
    := m (macro) 
  P := targeted language mode / program on the text editor / engine / ide
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: 
  yeWs := yas-snippet for emacs web-mode and it's a snippet
  
 Example: 
  yePs := yas-snippet for emacs php-mode and its a snippet 
  
 Example: 
  oeOt := org for emacs org-mode and it's a tangle 
  
 Example: 
  eeLm := elisp for emacs lisp-mode and it's a macro 
  
 Example: 
  svPs := snippet for vscode powershell and it's a snippet 
  

Map of branches:
